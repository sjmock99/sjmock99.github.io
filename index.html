          I am a passionate robotics mechanical engineer with a strong software background. I pride myself on being a "Swiss army knife", able to do hardware tasks such as CAD and machine design, to software tasks such as writing embedded drivers and programming robot behaviors with ROS. I love experimenting with microcontrollers, smaller computers, and hobbyist electronics to see how I can integrate them into everyday life (IoT). My life goal is to improve others' lives through the use of robotics and to educate and excite others about technology.
          I am primarily looking for opportunities to use robotics in consumer products and IoT, but am open to trying new things! I am currently based in LA.

        <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy playing sports, music, and video games. I used to play competitive ultimate frisbee for Georgia Tech's Mens Ultimate Frisbee Team as well as club teams in Atlanta and Boston. I grew up playing jazz saxophone and piano, but now make music in my free time. I enjoy traveling, and have been across Asia while studying abroad in China. I also started a small clothing brand when moving to LA, as well as used to model in college.
        </p>
      

		For fun, I also like to practice coding, and learn more about mechatronics and IoT. I have made various projects to integrate in my household, and have videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGEj8oX4HYpiRGQEBP7As9Q" target="_blank"> <u> YouTube channel </u> </a>   to teach and demonstrate DIY and programming concepts.</p>
